In 2023, my sister and I launched a podcast, Culture In Between, where we explore the unique experiences of people who have grown up in a culture outside their parents' culture. 
We were new to the whole process and had to do a lot of research to discover what was needed to successfully launch a new podcast. In this blog post, I’ll share the tools and information you’ll need in order to launch a podcast of your own.

## RSS Feeds
An RSS feed plays a crucial role in the distribution and accessibility of your podcast episodes. An RSS feed is essentially an XML file generated by your podcast hosting platform. 
This file contains important metadata about your podcast that services like Spotify and Apple Podcasts rely on to display your podcast accurately on their platforms. 
The RSS feed ensures that whenever you publish a new episode, it automatically updates across all platforms, making it easily accessible to your audience.

### Hosting
In order to obtain an RSS feed for your show, you need to sign up with a podcast hosting platform. Hosting platforms provide analytics services and manage your RSS feeds, allowing you to input and edit information about your show.

There are many podcast hosting platforms available, but here are a few options to consider:
- [Podbean](https://www.podbean.com/)
- [Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/)
- [Libsyn](https://libsyn.com/)
- [Transistor](https://transistor.fm/)

## Music
Music and sound design can set the tone of your podcast, but it's important to ensure the music is properly licensed. The key is to find royalty-free music, which means you don't have to pay royalties to the rights holders each time the song is used.

Here are some services offering royalty-free music:
- Epidemic Sound
- Pixabay
- Artlist
- Premium Beat

These platforms offer features like separate audio tracks for each participant, automatic backups, and basic editing capabilities.

- Figma
- Adobe Express
