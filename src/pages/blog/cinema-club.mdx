![Clapboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cool-Runningz/culture-in-between/refs/heads/main/public/images/blog/clapboard.jpg)

_Published: April 16, 2025_

We’re always looking for stories that reflect the reality of growing up across cultures—whether that’s figuring out where “home” really is, navigating 
family expectations, or just making sense of two (or more!) identities at once.

In the Season 3 opener of the podcast, we launched something a little different: Cinema Club. 
It's basically the movie version to our “Book Club” episode from last season. We picked five films that feel especially 
aligned with the heart of our show, and we dove into what made them stick with us—emotionally, culturally, and cinematically.

## 🎥 1. In the Heights
**Directed by:** Jon M. Chu  
**Starring:** Anthony Ramos, Melissa Barrera, Leslie Grace, Corey Hawkins  

**Key points:**  
- Set in NYC’s Washington Heights, this vibrant musical—based on Lin-Manuel Miranda’s first Broadway show—showcases a tight-knit Latino community with big dreams and strong roots.  
- The soundtrack blends rap and salsa, echoing the diverse voices of a neighborhood in transition.  

**Summary:** <br />
Set in the vibrant neighborhood of Washington Heights, this musical follows Usnavi, a bodega owner with big dreams of returning to the Dominican Republic. As he navigates love, community, and gentrification, he and his neighbors reflect on what home means and how to hold onto identity amid rapid change.

**Summary:** <br />
Nora and Hae Sung, childhood friends in South Korea, are separated when Nora’s family immigrated to the U.S. Years later, they reconnect in New York, where they confront questions of fate, love, and identity. A quiet, lyrical meditation on time, distance, and the paths we do—and don’t—take, the film beautifully explores the emotional pull of our cultural and personal pasts.
